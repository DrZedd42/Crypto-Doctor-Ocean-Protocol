## Inspiration
Taking advantage of work distribution upon doctors. In a capital city the capacity of work might be overflow but on the country side at the same time it might me the other way around. We implemented a solution to decentralize work and share tasks cleverly.

In addition, we create an incentive for additional diagnoses and the exchange of results of expertise and for research

## What it does
When you done a MRT scan those scans are analyzed by a professional doctor to predict certain diseases, this can take a huge amount of time, thus waiting for the patient, as well as uncertainty. 

With our solution the MRT scan gets encrypted locally and send to a client which, first, runs a machine learning model on it to make a initial guess plus its confidence. 

To ensure the machines prediction a bounty is associated to the task of prediction and spread to doctors around the world. The bounty is based on the confidence of the model, the higher the confidence the smaller the bounty. 

The doctors can accept the challenge and try to solve the task. If a sufficient amount of experts agree on a result, without knowing the others decision, the diagnoses will send back to patient. In parallel, the experts get their bounty plus a raise of reputation. With a higher reputation you are more likely to get higher bounty-tasks.

Meanwhile the pure meta data of the date and the final diagnoses will be added to a ocean protocol data set, which can be bought be researchers and insurances to adjust their approach of business.
